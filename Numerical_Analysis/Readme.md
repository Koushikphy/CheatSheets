## Numerical Analysis Problems:
### Beginner to Advanced level.
---

1. Given a positive integer number n, find the product/sum from 1 to n. Modify it to consider only even/odd number.
2. Make a number-guessing game. Print it the guessed number is too large or small in each step and print the number of tries at the end. Also, limit the maximum trial.
3. Find first n Fibonacci numbers.
4. Given two positive integer, find their GCD and LCM.
4. The 3n+1 problem/ [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). Take a positive integer n, if its odd do 3n+1, otherwise in case of even divide it by 2. Perform this repeatedly and verify the number of sequence always reaches to 4->2->1.
4. Take any (multi digit) number and calculate the sum of its digits. So for input 3456, output should be 3+4+5+6=18
4. Take the above number and reverse it. So, for input 3456, output should be 6543.
4. Given a positive integer n, find its factorial.
4. Given a positive integer n, print all prime numbers below or equal to n. Bonus: Use an efficient prime search algorithm.
4. Given a positive integer n, find all its prime factors.
4. Given a positive integer in decimal system, find its binary representation. Bonus: Convert a fraction from decimal to binary.
5. Find max/min value of an array.
5. Reverse a given array.
6. Sort an array: Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort.
7. Given three numbers a,b,c create an array of AP series with start value a, end value b, and common difference c. Also, create a GP series of the same.
8. Given three numbers a,b,c, create an array of AP series with start value a, end value b, and total length c. Also, create a GP series of the same.
9. Apply Sin/Cos to the grid created above, save in a file, and plot.
10. Derive the same result as the previous question but use the series expansion formula for sin and cos. Hint: Use a threshold value to terminate the series.
11. Use the result of the previous code to calculate the numerical derivative. Compare it with the actual.
12. Compute histogram of a set of data points. Use the intrinsic or any other random number generator to create the set. Comment on the type of the distribution from the histogram. Most of the intrinsic random number generators are uniform, can you construct a normal distribution from this?Â Bonus: Prove Central Limit Theorem (CLT). 
13. Simulate a Random Walk problem and prove that the distance d traveled is proportional to sqrt(N), where N is number of steps

	1. Calculate the roots of a quadratic equation.
	2. Bisection method.
	3. Fixed point iteration
	4. Secant and Newton-Raphson method. Also, find multiple roots/ roots of a polynomial with the latter. Also, find complex roots.
	5. Solve the system of linear equations with the exact solution. Tip: Use Gauss-Jordon elimination. Bonus & Advanced: solve a over/underdetermined system of equations.

20. Fourier transform:
	1. Write Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT). Identify the frequency of a given sine wave.
	2. Use Fast Fourier Transform(FFT). You can use a library interface like FFTW. Bonus: Code it yourself
	3. Find the derivative of a function using Fourier transform.
	4. remove noise from a sample data using fourier transformation.
